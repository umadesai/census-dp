This file serves as a list of things to edit, add, or remove -- to generally use as a dialogue. It is meant to be amended as we go. 

dp-count
  - [resolved] A few typos in text before In[3]
  - [resolved] Consider explicitly using "global sensitivity" to intoduce this concept in the text before In[5], so it's not confused with 
    local sensivity

dp-mean
  - [resolved] Perhaps explain in the preceeding text that the function avg_l1_mean is calculated from several runs of the dp_mean function
dp-median
  - [resolved] We can flesh out how to present smooth sesitivity. I like that there is already a skeleton outline here
dp-budget
  - [resolved] Composition Theorem: May want to state "When two answers are returned to an adversary, the total privacy loss can be twice
    as large..." I don't think there is no mention of serial vs. parallel composition up to this point, so may be good to hedge
    until those concepts are explianed later
dp-future
  - [resolved] Should bullet 2 read "... due to non-strictly-monotonic behavior..."?
dp-regression
  - It looks like we need an accuracy measure for each micro-data-set before the counts are postprocessed, correct?
  - After the ROC curve is presented, it would be nice to explicitly show what each method does to the regression
    coefficient(s)
  - The logistic regression example is looking good. Is the intent with the RR mechanism to bin the predictors before applying
    mechanism?
