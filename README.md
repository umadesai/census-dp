WIP. Algorithms are not formally private.

### How to install & run a notebook.

1. Install Anaconda (Census employees must submit a Remedy ticket).

2. Open an Anaconda prompt

3. Install git by typing the following into your Anaconda prompt and pressing enter.
```
conda install git
``` 

4. Navigate to the directory you would like to download this repository in. 

    *For example:*
```
cd Downloads/privacy/
```

5. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/umadesai/census-dp.git
```
6. Navigate to the notebooks folder.
```
cd census-dp/notebooks
```
7. Run Jupyter Notebook.
```
jupyter notebook
```
This command should launch Jupyter Notebook locally in your browser. If it does not, open your browser and navigate to the localhost address that is provided in your Anaconda prompt.

8. Click on the IPython Notebook you would like to open.

9. Reference [this sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Jupyter_Notebook_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) for help using Jupyter Notebook.
